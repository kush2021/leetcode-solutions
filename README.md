# LeetCode Solutions

This repository will contain code and explanations for LeetCode problems I solve. I plan on doing a problem a day. Currently, I'm working through solutions in C++ but I may consider delving into other programming languages into the future.

## C++ Configuration

I will be following [Google's C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) where possible. As the code will be exact LeetCode solutions, they will not be executable on their own.
