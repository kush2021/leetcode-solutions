# LeetCode Solutions

This website will contain code and explanations for LeetCode problems I solve.

## Languages

### C++

 - I will be using C++ 20 for all C++ solutions.
 - I will be following [Google's C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) where possible.
 - The files will not be executable/syntatically correct on their own.

## Motivation

The motivation for this project was to make learning programming as accessible as possible. I would like to provide clear, detailed, and concise explanations for problems that others may find challenging.

## Credits

The idea of documenting my solutions as an accessible website came from [P.-Y.Chen](https://walkccc.me/LeetCode/). However, all of the work is my own, unless otherwise noted.
