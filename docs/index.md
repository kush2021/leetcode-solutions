# LeetCode Solutions

This website will contain code and explanations for LeetCode problems I solve.

## Details

I will be using Python 3 to solve these problems. In addition, I will be using [Google's Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) to style my work. Rather than trying to write particularly efficient or concise code, I will attempt to write *clean* code, including using separate functions to increase readability.

The overall philosophy for solving these problems is that I will always strive to use the most efficient solution, considering both time and space complexity. For certain problems, the most efficient solution is rather unintuitive, but I will try my best to approach these problems from a ground-up level, explaining how to solve them without knowledge of certain niche algorithms.

## Motivation

The motivation for this project was to make learning data structures and algorithms as accessible as possible. I would like to provide clear, detailed, and concise explanations for problems that others may find challenging. I hope that others may benefit from these solutions.

## Credits

The idea of documenting my solutions as an accessible website came from [P.-Y.Chen](https://walkccc.me/LeetCode/). However, all of the work is my own, unless otherwise noted.
